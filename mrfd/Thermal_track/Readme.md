This folder conatins the model weights for every 10th epoch along with the losses in .npy files and images used to see the reconstruction quality of the output by the model at intermediate epochs. Every experiment is organised in a heirarichal order as: ```Thermal_track/<data_type>/<model_name>/<hyperparamter_name>```

Download the pre-trained weighted and other files from google drive link and place it in this folder:
