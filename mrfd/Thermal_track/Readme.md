This folder contains the model weights along with the losses in .npy files and images used to see the reconstruction quality of the output by the model at intermediate epochs. Every experiment is organized in a hierarchal order as: ```Thermal_track/<data_type>/<model_name>/<hyperparamter_name>```

To use the pre-trained model weights, download all the folders provided in the following link and place it in this folder:
